# EPSON EH-TW6100 3D LCD projector ballast hack using Ardunino

This project will help you to hack and emulate EPSON EH-TW6100 3D LCD projector ballast.

If we try to use any light source other than the stock one, the projector will go to error mode (will blink both error lights). 
To oversome this, you need to hack and emulate communication between Ballast and motherboard.
