Got the following data from http://forum.arduino.ua/viewtopic.php?id=125&p=3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wrote down signals of 4800 Evens, on the left is a request from the mother, on the right is the response from the ballast

the first group - immediately after switching on:

0xF2 - 0x04
0xF4 - 0xFF
0x40 - 0x40
0x32 - 0x32
0x84 - 0x02
0x83 - 0x64
0x81 - 0x17

the second group - after igniting the lamp:

0x81 - 0x97
0x40 - 0x40
0x34 - 0x34
0x84 - 0x04
0x83 - 0x46
_____________________

And this I chose one of the similar periodic regular signals during normal mode:

0x81 - 0x9B
0x92 - 0x1D
